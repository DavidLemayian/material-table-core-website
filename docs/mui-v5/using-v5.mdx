# Material-ui V5

### Reasoning

With `material-ui` v5 becoming stable with a beta on July 1st and being promoted as the version to use, we starting to support both version v4 and v5.

If you migrated to version 5 of `material-ui`, simply install our prerelease version to access the new version that supports v5.

### Yarn

`yarn add @material-table/core@next`

### NPM

`npm install @material-table/core@next`

### Breaking changes for v5

- `padding` now accepts 'normal' or 'dense'
- `onChangeRowsPerPage` => `onRowsPerPageChange`
- `onChangePage` => `onPageChange`

The version is still a work in progress and not fully tested.
