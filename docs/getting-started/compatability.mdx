If you can import it from `material-table` you can import it from `@material-table/core`. ~~This will never change.~~ Ok, we admit, that was a little bold. [Please see here for more info](breaking-changes).

```javascript
import MaterialTable, { 
  MTableAction, 
  /*, etc...*/ 
} from '@material-table/core';
```
