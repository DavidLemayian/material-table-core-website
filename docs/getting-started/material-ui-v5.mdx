# Using with @material-ui v5

The v5 version is always kept on par with the v4 branch expect the changes to make v5 workable.

## Breaking Changes

[See here for more](/docs/breaking-changes#material-ui-v5)

## Changes

The table icons are now supplied out-of-the-box, but can still be added to override them.

## Reasoning

With `material-ui` v5 becoming stable with a beta on July 1st and being promoted as the version to use, we starting to support both version v4 and v5.

Version after material-table-core 5.x is compatible with mui v4 and v5.
material-table-core 6.x is only compatible with version mui v5!!

## Installation

### Yarn

`yarn add @material-table/core@next`

### NPM

`npm install @material-table/core@next`
